          I'm a web developer in the Tampa Bay, FL area.  I have a number of things that I am passionate about,
          but web design and programming have always been high on my list of interests.  I grew an affinity for the tech industry
          in high school learning about graphic arts and production printing/screen printing, but it was the tech design part that always held my attention.
          After high school I began working in web design and development as a side option to a career in the service industry as a Bartender.  After 10+
          years of this, I decided to enroll in the Iron Yard, St. Pete.  I learned to refine my basic programming skills, and learned Javascript with a
          strong focus on ReactJS.  I also have a background using Wordpress.org for various websites.  My other passions include being a father/husband, music,
          movies and the film industry, and much more.  My goal is to take every project given to me, and to the best of my ability, move that project forward...
